# CoraLibre – Open Source version of the German Corona-Warn-App

**Note:** This app is not ready for any meaningful usage yet.

This app is a fork of the [official Corona-Warn-App](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android).
We're trying to keep the CoraLibre app close to the official app and frequently incorporate upstream
changes. The differences should be limited to branding and the replacement of the
Google Play Services, other changes should be made in the upstream repository.

## Contribution

Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project. To do so, please fork this repository and create
a new branch based off the `master` branch. Commit your changes to that new branch and open a new
pull request targeting the `master` branch again. As explained above, the changes to the app should
be very limited to maintain good mergeability with upstream. Be sure to open an issue and –
especially for bigger changes – discuss the proposed changes before implementing something that
won't be merged later.

Feel free to join us on our [public Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/!ytowiHTGWVFzpoihuQ:matrix.org), where
most discussions take place.

## Syncing with upstream

Upstream changes are regularly incorporated using git merges. The `master` branch of this repo
tracks the `master` branch of the upstream repository, because that branch contains the most stable
code and is presumably always be tested for release by SAP.

Upstream merges will be merged by @BjoernPetersen shortly after new non-RC releases are published
in the [corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android repo](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android).

### Merge checklist

The exact upstream merge process may vary wildly depending on the disruptivity of the changes to
be merged, but this section will roughly outline the merge process.

#### Prerequisites

- git remote `upstream` is set to `https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android.git`
- Active branch is `master` with no unstaged changes

#### Steps

- Fetch the newest commits from upstream: `git fetch upstream`
- Initialize the merge without auto-committing: `git merge --no-commit --no-ff upstream/master`
- Solve possible merge conflicts, prefer upstream changes
- Find and replace any possible (new) occurrences of "Corona-Warn-App" or just "Corona-Warn"
- Make sure to remove any reference to RKI endorsement or this being the official app
- Make sure there no instances of the Corona-Warn-App logo anywhere in the project
- Stage your changes: `git add -A`
- Commit the merge: `git commit`
- Push to origin: `git push`
